# Geolocation Classifier of Tweets
Final assignment for Introduction to Machine Learning (COMP90049). Given a dataset of tweets with their associated author's region label, we aim to investigate methods to recognize the region of the author of an unlabelled tweet. To this end, we benchmarked various feature extraction and classification techniques.

<br/><b>Feature Extraction Techniques:</b>
- Raw tweet
- Bag of Words
- TFIDF
- glove300

<b>Classification Techniques:</b>
- Multinomial Naive Bayes
- Logistic Regression
- MLP
- Decision Trees
